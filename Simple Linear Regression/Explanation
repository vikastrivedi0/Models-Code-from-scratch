Simple Linear Regression is the most basic and easiest prediction algorithm which uses basic equations to predict the statistical output for the given data.
The algorithm makes use of the simple line equation, i.e y = b + ax, to fit a line on the given datapoints.

This method in particular, uses the Pearsons's Correlation Coefficient to calculate the slope of the line.

Algorithm:
----------

  1. Calculate Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (r) with the below formula,
            
            r=∑(xi−mx)(yi−my)/√∑(xi−mx)2∑(yi−my)2
            
            where,
            xi => observation of x
            mx => mean(x)
            yi => observation of y
            my => mean(y)
  
  2. Calculate the slope (b) using r as follows,
  
            b=r(SD(y)/SD(x))
            
            where,
            SD(x) => Standard Deviation of x
            SD(y) => Standard Deviation of y
  
  3. Calculate the Y Intercept a using previously calculated slope b.
  
            a=my-b(mx)
            
            where,
            my => mean(y)
            mx => mean(x)
            b  => previously calculated slope
            
  4. Now, the value for y given the value of x can be predicted from the calculated slope (b) and Intercept (a) as:
          
            y^=a+b(x)
            
            where,
            y^ => predicted value of y
            a  => calculated Y Intercept
            b  => calculated Slope
